"The evaluation you're about to perform is a technique that has been developed by NASA to assess the relative importance of six factors in determining how much workload your experienced while performing a task that you recently completed. These six factors are defined on the following page. The answer will be checked manually, random answer won't score any credits. Mental Demand:How much mental and perceptual activity was required? Was the task easy or demanding, simple or complex? Physical Demand:How much physical activity was required? Was the task easy or demanding, slack or strenuous?. Temporal Demand: How much time pressure did you feel due to the pace at which the tasks or task elements occurred? Was the pace slow or rapid? Overall Performance: How successful were you in performing the task? How satisfied were you with your performance? Effort: How hard did you have to work (mentally and physically) to accomplish your level of performance? Frustration Level How irritated, stressed, and annoyed versus content, relaxed, and complacent did you feel during the task?{EOF}Type the factor below that represents the more important contributor to workload for the specific task that you recently perform:Frustration or Physical Demand{EOF}Type the factor below that represents the more important contributor to workload for the specific task that you recently perform:Frustration or Mental Demand{EOF}Type the factor below that represents the more important contributor to workload for the specific task that you recently perform:Physical Demand or Performance{EOF}Type the factor below that represents the more important contributor to workload for the specific task that you recently perform:Temporal Demand or Effort"
